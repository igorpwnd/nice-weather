# Weather App

This is a small weather application that includes:

- **Backend**: Built with Bun, Express, and Axios.
- **Frontend**: Built with Vite and React.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Running the Application

To build and start both the backend and frontend, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The backend and frontend will be set up and available after this command completes.

## Accessing the Application

- **Frontend**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/`.
- **Backend**: The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.


Since it's just a test, i'm not worried with the .env file
